        <p>Hello, I am Jess Alicando from the Philippines. I am 26 years old and currently working as a Facilities
            Engineer at a Semiconductor Assembly Company for a year now. I served my mission at Philippines Cagayan De Oro Mission and
            returned home on March 2024, I will never forget all of the spiritual and also fun experiences I have that time, it's one of
            the defining moments of my life. My current hobbies are binge watching shows on Netflix and playing the Piano. I took up this
            course because I want to increase my knowledge and skills in software development, which will allow me to find a better job in
            the future. I already have previous background with the use of HTML and its use for web design as a technical vocational subject
            during my high school years, that was way back 13 years ago. I hope I can still recall some of the concepts and principles that I've
            learned from that subject. I am looking forward to meet you all and to share my knowledge and skills for this course!
